As an experiment I'm going to start streaming some of my open source maintenance. I have a bunch of ideas of types of streams and videos I could make, so here are some goals to help make decisions.

Inspired by the time constraints from the podcasts Under the Radar and Developing Perspective I plan to time constrain my videos. https://www.relay.fm/radar/191

## Goals

- Become proficient at making single take instructional videos.
- Get more people into software development and open source.
- Promote the open source projects that I work on.
- Continue growing the OSS communities I'm a part of and also building my following, especially on Twitter.

## Format ideas

 - 30 minute PR - aim to resolve an issue by raising a PR in under 30 minutes.
 - 5 minute tuorial - explain a topic in under 5 minutes.
 - Friday Hacks - Hack on a small idea for an hour or two as a Friday treat.
 
## My setup

Here's an overview of my software and hardware setup for streaming. I'm starting out with the things I have to hand, but will upgrade things as my audience grows.

### Hardware

- MacBook Pro 15 inch 2019
- External Dell monitor
- FaceTime HD 720p camera
- Sony WH-1000XM3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones (for audio and microphone)
- Original Apple Magic Mouse (A1296)
- Akko 3068 keyboard

### Software

- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)
- [Stream Elements](https://streamelements.com/) for overlays
- [Restream](https://restream.io) for aggregated chat and multi-platform streaming
