As an experiment I'm going to start streaming some of my open source maintenance. I have a bunch of ideas of types of streams and videos I could make, so here are some goals to help make decisions.

Inspired by the time constraints from the podcasts Under the Radar and Developing Perspective I plan to time constrain my videos. https://www.relay.fm/radar/191

## Goals

Long term personal and professional goals that I want to tackle using streaming.

- Become proficient at making single take instructional videos.
- Get more people into software development and open source.
- Promote the open source projects that I work on.
- Continue growing the OSS communities I'm a part of and also building my following, especially on Twitter.
- Build rich library of instructional video content.

## Objectives

Short term objectives that I want to continuously hit.

- Stream at least three times a week.
- Publish stream content as videos on YouTube.

## Format ideas

 - 30 minute PR - Aim to resolve an issue by raising a PR in under 30 minutes. 
   - Structured stream with time limits and an explicit format but can pause to engage in chat.
 - Half Day Hacks - Hack on a small idea for half a day to see if it has legs. 
   - More of a casual fly on the wall type stream. Lots of chat encouraged.
 - 5 minute tuorial - Explain a topic in under 5 minutes.
   - More of a video style stream. No chat. Rigid format. Great for reuse.
   - Would likely be recorded during other streams as an aside. If a user asks a question in chart we would pause what we are doing, switch to a different scene profile and record a standalone video. Then when that is done we would return to the stream we were doing before.
 
## My setup

Here's an overview of my software and hardware setup for streaming. I'm starting out with the things I have to hand, but will upgrade things as my audience grows.

### Hardware

- MacBook Pro 15 inch 2019
- External Dell monitor
- FaceTime HD 720p camera
- Sony WH-1000XM3 Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones (for audio and microphone)
- Original Apple Magic Mouse (A1296)
- Akko 3068 keyboard

### Software

- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)
- [Stream Elements](https://streamelements.com/) for overlays
- [Restream](https://restream.io) for aggregated chat and multi-platform streaming
