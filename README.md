As an experiment I'm going to start streaming some of my open source maintenance. I have a bunch of ideas of types of streams and videos I could make, so here are some goals to help make decisions.

Inspired by the time constraints from the podcasts Under the Radar and Developing Perspective I plan to time constrain my videos. https://www.relay.fm/radar/191

## Goals

- Become proficient at making single take instructional videos.
- Get more people into software development and open source.
- Promote the open source projects that I work on.
- Continue building my following, especially on Twitter.

## Format ideas

 - 30 minute PR - aim to resolve an issue by raising a PR in under 30 minutes
 - 5 minute tuorial - explain a topic in under 5 minutes
 - Friday Hacks - Hack on a small idea for an hour or two as a Friday treat
